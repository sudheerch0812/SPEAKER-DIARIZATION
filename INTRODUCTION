Sound diarisation, also known as speaker diarisation, is a fundamental task in audio
signal processing that involves the segmentation of an audio stream into distinct
segments corresponding to different speakers or sound sources. This process is
essential for numerous applications, including speech recognition, speaker
identification, and content analysis. By automatically partitioning audio data into
speaker-specific segments, sound diarisation enables efficient organization,
retrieval, and analysis of audio content across various domains.
The importance of sound diarisation stems from its role in enabling advanced audio
processing tasks. In speech recognition systems, accurate segmentation of audio
streams into speaker-specific segments improves the performance of automatic
speech recognition by providing context and speaker-specific information to the
recognition algorithms. Similarly, in speaker identification and verification
systems, sound diarisation assists in separating speech from different speakers,
facilitating the identification and authentication of individuals based on their voice
characteristics.
